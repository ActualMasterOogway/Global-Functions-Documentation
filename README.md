# ðŸ”¨ sUNC Function Documentation

If you're running short on time or do not like reading AT ALL, you can read the condensed version of this README [here](./README-condensed.md).

## What is sUNC? ðŸ¤”

**sUNC**, short for **senS' Unified Naming Convention**, is a testing tool designed to validate an executor's ability to implement necessary global functions under the already existing [Unified Naming Convention](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main). Unlike the original UNC, which is now deprecated and prone to spoofing, sUNC rigorously evaluates function implementations to ensure full functionality and authenticity.

### Key Features

- sUNC has a focus on **validation**: Tests are designed to verify that functions operate correctly, by running the functions under many tests to confirm the results.
- sUNC enforces **transparency** and **accountability**: The script exposes fake, or poorly implemented functions to protect users from misleading claims and help developers improve their environment.
- sUNC is constantly being updated with test improvements, ensuring it remains as good as gold for testing executor validity.
- sUNC is obfuscated, this might seem like a bad thing but it is like that to avoid executor devs from looking at the tests and making their functions return exactly what the test wants, this is what bad executors already do on the original [Original UNC](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main).
