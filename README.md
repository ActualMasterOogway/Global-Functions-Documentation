# sUNC Introduction

If you're interested in senS' (Owner's) monologue, you can view it [here](./README-condensed.md).

## What is sUNC? 

**sUNC**, short for **senS' Unified Naming Convention**. It's a testing tool designed to validate an executor's ability to implement necessary global functions under the already existing [Unified Naming Convention](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main). Unlike the original UNC, which is now deprecated and prone to spoofing, sUNC rigorously evaluates function implementations to ensure full functionality and authenticity.

### Key Features

- sUNC has a focus on **validation**: Tests are designed to verify that functions operate correctly, by running the functions under many tests to confirm the results.
- sUNC enforces **transparency** and **accountability**: The script exposes fake, or poorly implemented functions to protect users from misleading claims and help developers improve their environment.
- sUNC is constantly being updated with test improvements, ensuring it remains as good as gold for testing executor validity.
- sUNC is obfuscated. This might seem like a bad thing, but the intention is to prevent spoofing, and not gatekeeping function checks. Many executors already fake their environments to suit the [Original UNC](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard/tree/main).
- The owner will never gatekeep function checks from the developers requesting them for improvement purposes.
